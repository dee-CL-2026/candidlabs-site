# Candidlabs Brainstorm

Ideas and explorations that haven't made it to the roadmap yet. Not all of these will be built - this is a space to capture thoughts before they're forgotten.

## Ideas

### Project Status Dashboard
**Added:** 2026-02-04
Display project status for each active project. Samples to be shared for reference.

### Budget Planner Layout Improvements
**Added:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** ✅ Completed - Implemented sidebar navigation layout

### Monthly Planner Tool
**Added:** 2026-02-04
Detailed budget planning tool with 12-month breakdown. Allow line-by-line entry for each P&L line (Revenue, COGS, OpEx categories) across all months of 2026. Should integrate with existing scenarios and show monthly vs annual totals.

### Quick Access External Links
**Added:** 2026-02-04
Identify other useful shortcuts beyond Submit Expenses - what external tools does the team use frequently?

### Taste Your Spirit Card
**Added:** 2026-02-04
Homepage card featuring the company tagline. Ideas for content:
- **Inspirational quotes** - Rotating daily/weekly quotes about teamwork, innovation, craft
- **Team check-in questions** - Simple reflection prompts like "What energised you this week?" or "What's one thing you're proud of today?"
- **Wellness pulse** - Quick emoji-based mood check (optional anonymous submission)
- **Fun facts** - Random facts about mixers, spirits, or the beverage industry
- **Team shoutouts** - Highlight recent wins or kudos from colleagues

Could eventually integrate with a simple backend to rotate content or collect responses.

### On-Screen Help & Guided Tours
**Added:** 2026-02-04
Interactive step-by-step guides for each page/tool. Click-by-click walkthroughs to help users learn the platform.
- Highlight elements one at a time with explanatory tooltips
- "Next/Back/Skip" navigation through the tour
- Option to restart tour from help menu
- Could use a library like Intro.js, Shepherd.js, or Driver.js
- Will need to be updated as the platform evolves
- Consider: first-time user auto-trigger vs manual "Help" button
