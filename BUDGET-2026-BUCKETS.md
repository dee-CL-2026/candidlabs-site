# Candid Mixers — FY2026 Budget (Bottom-Up Buckets)
**PT Unisoda Mitra Jaya**  
*Prepared: February 2026 | Currency: IDR*

---

## Methodology

This version builds revenue **bottom-up from specific channel buckets** rather than top-down percentage growth. Based on Anders planning call (Feb 4, 2026).

**Approach:**
1. Take FY2025 baseline
2. Apply modest organic growth to existing channels
3. **Add specific new channel buckets** with realistic ramp-ups
4. Model 3 scenarios with different bucket volumes

---

## FY2025 Baseline

| Metric | FY2025 Actual |
|--------|---------------|
| Revenue | 5.52B |
| Cases (est.) | ~58,700 |
| COGS % | 45.2% |
| Gross Margin | 54.8% |
| Net Profit | 445M |

**Estimated avg price/case:** ~94,000 IDR (blended across SKUs)

---

## SKU Mix Assumptions

Based on Dee's guidance (Feb 5):

| SKU | Mix % | Price/Case | Notes |
|-----|-------|------------|-------|
| Club Soda | 65% | 90,000 | Volume leader |
| Imperio Tonic | 30% | 102,000 | Premium positioning |
| Ginger Ale | 5% | 102,000 | "Very light" - niche |
| **Blended Avg** | 100% | **94,200** | Used for calculations |

### New SKUs (Green Tea + Nipis Madu)
| Scenario | Launch Timing | SKUs Launched |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Conservative | Q4 | 1 only |
| Base | Q4 | Both |
| Stretch | Q3 | Both |

**New SKU pricing assumption:** 102,000/case (same as Imperio/Ginger tier)

## 🚨 DATA NEEDED: Finns

> *"I am not sure I have shared that with you yet"* — Dee
>
> Need: Current Finns volume (cases/month or annual), pricing, expected FY26 trajectory.
> 
> **Placeholder:** Assuming Finns continues at ~1,580M annual (from top-down draft) until updated.

## Revenue Buckets

### Existing Channels (FY2025 → FY2026)

| Channel | FY2025 | Organic Growth | FY2026 Base |
|---------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Existing On-Trade** (SKD accounts) | ~3.9B | +10% | 4.3B |
| **Finns** | ~1.6B | ⚠️ TBD | 1.6B |
| **FY2025 Total** | 5.5B | | 5.9B |

### NEW Channel Buckets (Anders Call Structure)

These are the **incremental** revenue sources to add on top of baseline:

| Bucket | Cases/Month | Annual Cases | Revenue/Year | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **HWG (Holywings Group)** | ⬜ | | | 40+ outlets nationally |
| **Big Chains (LYD, Club Med)** | ⬜ | | | Hotel/resort groups |
| **Modern Trade** | ⬜ | | | Supermarkets, minimarks |
| **Hotels** | ⬜ | | | Individual hotel accounts |
| **New SKUs (H2)** | ⬜ | | | Green Tea + Nipis Madu |

---

## Scenario Volumes

Based on Anders call guidance. ⬜ = needs your input to confirm.

### Conservative (50% growth target → ~8.3B)

| Bucket | Cases/Month | Ramp | Annual Cases | Revenue |
|--------|-------------|------|--------------|---------|
| HWG | 500 | Full year | 6,000 | 565M |
| Big Chains | 300 | Q2 start | 2,700 | 254M |
| Modern Trade | 800 | Gradual | 7,200 | 678M |
| Hotels | 400 | Gradual | 3,600 | 339M |
| New SKUs | - | Q4, 1 SKU | 2,000 | 204M |
| **Bucket Total** | | | **21,500** | **2.04B** |

**Conservative Total:** 5.9B (base) + 2.04B (buckets) = **7.94B** ❌ (below 8.3B target)

*Need to adjust bucket volumes up OR increase organic growth.*

---

### Base (75% growth target → ~9.7B)

| Bucket | Cases/Month | Ramp | Annual Cases | Revenue |
|--------|-------------|------|--------------|---------|
| HWG | 1,000 | Full year | 12,000 | 1.13B |
| Big Chains | 1,000 | Q2 start | 9,000 | 848M |
| Modern Trade | 2,000 | Gradual | 18,000 | 1.70B |
| Hotels | 1,000 | Q2 start | 9,000 | 848M |
| New SKUs | - | Q4, both | 4,000 | 408M |
| **Bucket Total** | | | **52,000** | **4.93B** |

**Base Total:** 5.9B (base) + 4.93B (buckets) = **10.83B** ✅ (exceeds 9.7B target)

*These are the bucket numbers from the Anders call. Result lands closer to stretch territory!*

---

### Stretch (100% growth target → ~11B)

| Bucket | Cases/Month | Ramp | Annual Cases | Revenue |
|--------|-------------|------|--------------|---------|
| HWG | 1,200 | Full year | 14,400 | 1.36B |
| Big Chains | 1,200 | Q1 start | 13,200 | 1.24B |
| Modern Trade | 2,500 | Aggressive | 27,000 | 2.54B |
| Hotels | 1,200 | Q1 start | 13,200 | 1.24B |
| New SKUs | - | Q3, both | 8,000 | 816M |
| **Bucket Total** | | | **75,800** | **7.20B** |

**Stretch Total:** 5.9B (base) + 7.20B (buckets) = **13.1B** ⚠️ (exceeds 11B target significantly)

---

## 🔴 Observation: Bucket Math vs Targets

The bucket volumes from the Anders call (1k/1k/2k/1k = 5k new cases/month) produce revenue that **exceeds** the stated growth targets:

| Scenario | Target | Bucket Result | Delta |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Conservative | 8.3B | 7.94B | -4% |
| Base | 9.7B | 10.83B | +12% |
| Stretch | 11.0B | 13.1B | +19% |

**Options:**
1. Bucket volumes are aspirational maximums (not guaranteed)
2. Adjust bucket volumes down for conservative/base
3. Accept higher growth potential if buckets deliver
4. Factor in ramp-up delays (not all buckets from month 1)

**Recommend:** Build in realistic ramp-up curves. Not all buckets hit full volume from January.

## Marketing Budget

> ⚠️ **Needs clarification on units**
>
> Dee mentioned: "70k 50k same as this year, 10k extras for paid campaigns, 10k for Press release budget (4 x qrtly PRs)"
>
> Interpreting as millions (M IDR):
> - Base marketing: 70M + 50M = 120M (same as FY25?)
> - Paid campaigns: +10M
> - PR budget: +10M (4 quarterly releases)
> - **Total: 140M?**
>
> But FY25 marketing was **533M**. Need to clarify what "70k 50k" refers to.

### FY25 Marketing Actual
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Marketing | 533M |
| Advertising | 7M |
| **Total** | 540M |

---

## Cost Structure (Applying to Scenarios)

Using FY25 ratios with target improvements:

| Metric | FY25 | Conservative | Base | Stretch |
|--------|------|--------------|------|---------|
| COGS % | 45.2% | 45% | 44% | 43% |
| Gross Margin | 54.8% | 55% | 56% | 57% |

### P&L Skeleton (Base Scenario)

```
Revenue:           10.83B
COGS (44%):        -4.77B
Gross Profit:       6.06B (56%)

OpEx:              ~3.5-4.0B (TBD)
EBITDA:            ~2.0-2.5B
Net Profit:        ~1.5-2.0B
```

*OpEx breakdown needs detailing based on marketing clarification and headcount plan.*

## Next Steps / Gaps to Fill

- [ ] **Finns data** — Current volumes, FY26 trajectory
- [ ] **Marketing budget clarification** — What does "70k 50k" mean?
- [ ] **Ramp-up assumptions** — When does each bucket actually start delivering?
- [ ] **Validate bucket volumes** — Are 1k/1k/2k/1k cases/month realistic or aspirational?
- [ ] **COGS by channel** — Different margins for Modern Trade vs On-Trade?

---

## Comparison: Top-Down vs Bottom-Up

| Approach | Method | Base Revenue | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Top-Down** (BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md) | FY25 × 1.75 | 9.66B | Simple, arbitrary |
| **Bottom-Up** (this doc) | FY25 + Buckets | 10.83B | Grounded in channel commitments |

The bottom-up approach with Anders' bucket numbers suggests **higher growth potential** than the top-down targets assumed.
